# HR Document Markdown Refactor - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the refactoring of the HR document management system to replace file uploads with a markdown-based text editor system. The goal is to simplify document creation and management by allowing users to create and edit documents directly within the application using markdown syntax, eliminating the need for external file uploads.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove File Upload Functionality

**User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want to create documents directly in the application without needing to upload files, so that I can quickly create and manage documentation without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the document library THEN the file upload interface SHALL be removed
2. WHEN creating a new document THEN the system SHALL provide a markdown text editor interface
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN existing file upload endpoints SHALL be deprecated but remain functional for backward compatibility
4. WHEN viewing the document creation form THEN file selection inputs SHALL not be present

### Requirement 2: Implement Markdown Text Editor

**User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want to use a rich markdown editor to create documents, so that I can format content with headers, lists, links, and other markdown features easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new document THEN the system SHALL provide a markdown editor with live preview
2. WHEN editing document content THEN the editor SHALL support standard markdown syntax (headers, lists, links, bold, italic, code blocks)
3. WHEN using the editor THEN it SHALL provide toolbar buttons for common formatting options
4. WHEN typing in the editor THEN it SHALL provide real-time preview of the rendered markdown
5. WHEN saving a document THEN the markdown content SHALL be stored as text in the database
6. WHEN the editor loads THEN it SHALL support syntax highlighting for markdown

### Requirement 3: Update Database Schema

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database to efficiently store markdown content instead of file references, so that documents are self-contained and easier to manage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration runs THEN a new `content` text field SHALL be added to the hr_documents table
2. WHEN the migration runs THEN the `file_path`, `file_type`, and `file_size` fields SHALL be marked as nullable for backward compatibility
3. WHEN creating new markdown documents THEN the `content` field SHALL store the raw markdown text
4. WHEN querying documents THEN the system SHALL differentiate between file-based and markdown-based documents
5. WHEN searching documents THEN the search SHALL include content from the markdown text

### Requirement 4: Document Rendering and Display

**User Story:** As an organization member, I want to view markdown documents with proper formatting, so that I can read the content in a well-structured and visually appealing format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a markdown document THEN the content SHALL be rendered as HTML with proper formatting
2. WHEN displaying rendered content THEN it SHALL support GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) features
3. WHEN rendering markdown THEN it SHALL sanitize HTML to prevent XSS attacks
4. WHEN viewing a document THEN it SHALL maintain the same acknowledgment functionality as file-based documents
5. WHEN printing a document THEN the rendered content SHALL be print-friendly

### Requirement 5: Document Version Control

**User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want to track changes to markdown documents, so that I can maintain version history and see what content has been modified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing a markdown document THEN the system SHALL increment the version number
2. WHEN saving changes THEN the system SHALL update the `updated_at` timestamp
3. WHEN viewing document history THEN users SHALL see version information
4. WHEN a document is updated THEN existing acknowledgments SHALL remain valid unless the document requires re-acknowledgment
5. WHEN comparing versions THEN the system SHALL show what content changed (future enhancement)

### Requirement 6: Migration and Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want existing file-based documents to continue working while new documents use markdown, so that the transition is seamless for users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is updated THEN existing file-based documents SHALL continue to function normally
2. WHEN viewing the document library THEN both file-based and markdown documents SHALL be displayed together
3. WHEN accessing legacy file documents THEN they SHALL maintain their download functionality
4. WHEN creating new documents THEN only the markdown editor SHALL be available
5. WHEN migrating THEN no existing data SHALL be lost or corrupted

### Requirement 7: Search and Content Indexing

**User Story:** As an organization member, I want to search within document content, so that I can find specific information across all documents regardless of their format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching documents THEN the search SHALL include markdown content text
2. WHEN performing a search THEN results SHALL highlight matching content snippets
3. WHEN indexing documents THEN both file-based and markdown documents SHALL be searchable
4. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL provide relevant results ranked by content relevance
5. WHEN displaying search results THEN they SHALL show context around the matched terms

### Requirement 8: Export and Import Functionality

**User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want to export markdown documents to various formats, so that I can share them outside the system or create backups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting a markdown document THEN the system SHALL provide options for PDF, HTML, and raw markdown formats
2. WHEN importing content THEN the system SHALL accept markdown files for bulk document creation
3. WHEN exporting THEN the document metadata (title, description, acknowledgment status) SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN importing THEN the system SHALL validate markdown syntax and provide error feedback
5. WHEN exporting to PDF THEN the formatting SHALL be preserved and print-ready

### Requirement 9: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive interface for creating and editing markdown documents, so that I can focus on content creation without technical barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a document THEN the interface SHALL provide clear navigation between edit and preview modes
2. WHEN using the editor THEN it SHALL provide helpful tooltips and keyboard shortcuts
3. WHEN saving a document THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about save status
4. WHEN the editor loads THEN it SHALL be responsive and work well on different screen sizes
5. WHEN switching between documents THEN unsaved changes SHALL be preserved or the user SHALL be warned

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the markdown document system to perform well with large documents and many concurrent users, so that the system remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading large markdown documents THEN the editor SHALL render within 2 seconds
2. WHEN multiple users edit documents simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access gracefully
3. WHEN storing markdown content THEN the database SHALL efficiently index text content for search
4. WHEN rendering documents THEN the system SHALL cache rendered HTML to improve performance
5. WHEN the system scales THEN markdown documents SHALL not significantly impact database performance compared to file-based documents
