# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the remaining dummy data usage in the HR Management System frontend components. While the backend APIs and most frontend components are implemented, several areas still use hardcoded placeholder data instead of connecting to real backend endpoints. This creates a poor user experience and prevents the HR system from functioning as intended.

The goal is to eliminate all dummy data usage and ensure all frontend components properly integrate with the existing backend APIs to display real, dynamic data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: HR Dashboard Recent Activity Integration

**User Story:** As an organization administrator, I want to see real recent HR activities in the dashboard, so that I can stay informed about actual events happening in my organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the HR dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real recent activities from the backend API instead of hardcoded placeholder data
2. WHEN recent activities are loaded THEN the system SHALL show actual user handles, timestamps, and activity descriptions from the database
3. WHEN no recent activities exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
4. WHEN activities are updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the activity feed automatically using RTK Query cache invalidation
5. WHEN viewing activities THEN the system SHALL display proper relative timestamps (e.g., "2 hours ago") calculated from real data
6. WHEN activities include user actions THEN the system SHALL show actual user information instead of "John_Doe" and "Jane_Smith" placeholders
7. WHEN loading activities THEN the system SHALL show loading states and handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 2: Skills Matrix Real Statistics Integration

**User Story:** As an HR manager, I want to see actual skill statistics for each skill, so that I can understand the real skill distribution in my organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing skills in the skills matrix THEN the system SHALL display real member counts and verification percentages from the backend
2. WHEN skill statistics are calculated THEN the system SHALL show actual numbers of members with each skill instead of hardcoded zeros
3. WHEN verification rates are displayed THEN the system SHALL calculate real percentages based on verified vs unverified skills
4. WHEN skills have no members THEN the system SHALL display "0" but fetch this from actual data queries
5. WHEN skill data is updated THEN the system SHALL refresh statistics automatically using proper cache invalidation
6. WHEN viewing skill gaps THEN the system SHALL display real gap analysis data from the analytics API
7. WHEN skills are added or removed THEN the system SHALL update statistics in real-time

### Requirement 3: Document Library Acknowledgment Status Integration

**User Story:** As an organization member, I want to see real document acknowledgment status, so that I know which documents I have actually acknowledged and which require my attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing documents THEN the system SHALL display real acknowledgment status from the backend API instead of random simulation
2. WHEN a document requires acknowledgment THEN the system SHALL show actual acknowledgment status based on user's acknowledgment history
3. WHEN acknowledging a document THEN the system SHALL update the status immediately and persist it to the backend
4. WHEN viewing acknowledgment status THEN the system SHALL show accurate timestamps and user information
5. WHEN documents don't require acknowledgment THEN the system SHALL not display acknowledgment status indicators
6. WHEN acknowledgment status changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI immediately using optimistic updates
7. WHEN loading acknowledgment data THEN the system SHALL handle loading states and errors appropriately

### Requirement 4: Missing API Endpoints Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all necessary API endpoints to be available, so that frontend components can fetch real data instead of using placeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend components need recent activity data THEN the system SHALL provide a dedicated HR activities API endpoint
2. WHEN skills statistics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for skill member counts and verification rates
3. WHEN document acknowledgment data is needed THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for acknowledgment status and history
4. WHEN user skill data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for user-skill relationships with proper statistics
5. WHEN activity feeds are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide paginated activity endpoints with proper filtering
6. WHEN real-time updates are needed THEN the system SHALL support proper cache invalidation and data refresh
7. WHEN API responses are returned THEN they SHALL follow consistent response formats matching existing patterns

### Requirement 5: RTK Query Integration Completion

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want all HR components to use RTK Query properly, so that data fetching is consistent and efficient across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HR components need data THEN they SHALL use RTK Query hooks instead of hardcoded values
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL use proper caching strategies with appropriate `keepUnusedDataFor` values
3. WHEN data is updated THEN the system SHALL use RTK Query mutations with proper cache invalidation tags
4. WHEN loading states are needed THEN components SHALL use RTK Query's built-in loading states
5. WHEN errors occur THEN components SHALL handle RTK Query error states appropriately
6. WHEN data needs to be refreshed THEN the system SHALL use RTK Query's refetch capabilities
7. WHEN optimistic updates are appropriate THEN the system SHALL implement them using RTK Query patterns

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see appropriate loading and error states, so that I understand when data is being fetched or when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is being loaded THEN the system SHALL display skeleton loaders or loading indicators
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL show user-friendly error messages with retry options
3. WHEN no data is available THEN the system SHALL display appropriate empty states with helpful messaging
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and recovery options
5. WHEN data is stale THEN the system SHALL indicate when data was last updated
6. WHEN retrying failed requests THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback during retry attempts
7. WHEN partial data is available THEN the system SHALL display what it can while indicating missing information

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the HR system to load quickly and efficiently, so that I can work productively without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading HR data THEN the system SHALL implement efficient caching strategies to minimize API calls
2. WHEN displaying large datasets THEN the system SHALL use pagination and virtual scrolling where appropriate
3. WHEN data is frequently accessed THEN the system SHALL cache it appropriately using RTK Query
4. WHEN multiple components need the same data THEN the system SHALL share cached data efficiently
5. WHEN data updates occur THEN the system SHALL use selective cache invalidation to minimize unnecessary refetches
6. WHEN components unmount THEN the system SHALL clean up subscriptions and prevent memory leaks
7. WHEN background updates are needed THEN the system SHALL implement efficient polling or real-time updates

### Requirement 8: Data Consistency and Synchronization

**User Story:** As an organization administrator, I want HR data to be consistent across all components, so that I see accurate and up-to-date information everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is updated in one component THEN all other components SHALL reflect the changes immediately
2. WHEN multiple users are viewing the same data THEN they SHALL see consistent information
3. WHEN data conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them using appropriate conflict resolution strategies
