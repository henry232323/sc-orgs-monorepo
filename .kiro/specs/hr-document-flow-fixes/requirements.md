# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical issues in the HR document creation flow and related functionality. The current system has several bugs that prevent proper document creation, skills management, and performance review workflows. These issues impact user experience and prevent core HR functionality from working correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Document Creation Auto-Save

**User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want the document creation auto-save to actually create documents in the backend, so that my work is properly saved and I don't lose content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new document and the auto-save triggers THEN the system SHALL make an actual API call to create the document
2. WHEN the auto-save completes successfully THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the document has been created
3. WHEN the auto-save fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
4. WHEN a user manually saves a new document THEN the system SHALL create the document if it doesn't exist or update it if it does

### Requirement 2: Use Organization-Specific Access Roles

**User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want the document access roles to reflect my organization's actual roles, so that I can properly control document access based on real organizational structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or editing a document THEN the access roles dropdown SHALL display roles specific to the current organization
2. WHEN no organization roles are available THEN the system SHALL fall back to default roles with appropriate messaging

2. WHEN skills data is loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states
3. WHEN skills data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display error messages and retry options
4. WHEN pagination controls are rendered THEN they SHALL only appear when valid pagination data exists

### Requirement 4: Fix Skills Dropdown in User Skills

**User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want to see actual organizational skills in the skills dropdown, so that I can properly assign skills to users.

1. WHEN adding a user skill THEN the skills dropdown SHALL display all available organizational skills
2. WHEN skills are loading THEN the dropdown SHALL show a loading state
3. WHEN no skills are available THEN the dropdown SHALL display an appropriate message
4. WHEN skills fail to load THEN the system SHALL provide retry functionality

### Requirement 5: Fix Performance Review Member Selection

**User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want an autocomplete member selection dropdown for performance reviews, so that I can easily find and select organization members to review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a performance review THEN the member selection SHALL be an autocomplete dropdown
2. WHEN typing in the member field THEN the system SHALL filter members based on the input
3. WHEN no members match the search THEN the system SHALL display "No members found" message
