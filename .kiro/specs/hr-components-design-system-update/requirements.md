# HR Components Design System Update - Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for updating all HR components to consistently use the established design system and glass morphism theming. The goal is to ensure visual consistency, improved user experience, and maintainable code across all HR-related components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Design System Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want all HR components to have a consistent visual appearance and behavior, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any HR component THEN it SHALL use the established CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, and typography
2. WHEN interacting with form elements THEN they SHALL use the glass morphism styling with consistent hover and focus states
3. WHEN viewing buttons THEN they SHALL use the Button component with appropriate variants (primary, secondary, ghost, etc.)
4. WHEN viewing input fields THEN they SHALL use the Input, Textarea, and Checkbox components with consistent styling
5. WHEN viewing containers THEN they SHALL use the Paper component with appropriate glass variants

### Requirement 2: Create Document Form Enhancement

**User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want the Create Document form to use the modern design system components, so that it matches the rest of the application's visual style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening the Create Document form THEN it SHALL use the glass morphism modal styling with proper backdrop blur
2. WHEN viewing form inputs THEN they SHALL use the Input and Textarea components with glass styling
3. WHEN viewing the checkbox THEN it SHALL use the Checkbox component with brand colors
4. WHEN viewing form buttons THEN they SHALL use the Button component with appropriate variants
5. WHEN viewing form labels THEN they SHALL use consistent typography classes (text-primary, font-semibold)
6. WHEN viewing the form container THEN it SHALL use proper spacing variables (--spacing-card-lg, --spacing-element)

### Requirement 3: Select Component Creation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Select component that matches the design system, so that dropdown selections are consistent with other form elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a Select component THEN it SHALL use glass morphism styling consistent with Input components
2. WHEN the Select is focused THEN it SHALL show the same focus states as other form elements
3. WHEN the Select dropdown is open THEN it SHALL use glass styling with proper backdrop blur
4. WHEN selecting options THEN they SHALL have hover states consistent with the design system
5. WHEN the Select is disabled THEN it SHALL show the same disabled styling as other form elements

### Requirement 4: HR Component Audit and Update

**User Story:** As a user, I want all HR components (document library, performance forms, onboarding checklists, etc.) to use the consistent design system, so that the entire HR section feels unified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Document Library THEN it SHALL use consistent Paper variants for containers
2. WHEN viewing the Performance Review Form THEN it SHALL use design system form components
3. WHEN viewing the Onboarding Checklist THEN it SHALL use the Checkbox component and consistent styling
4. WHEN viewing the Application Form THEN it SHALL use design system form components
5. WHEN viewing the HR Dashboard THEN it SHALL use consistent Paper, Button, and typography components
6. WHEN viewing any HR component THEN it SHALL use the established color variables (--color-text-primary, --color-glass-bg, etc.)

### Requirement 5: Form Validation and Error States

**User Story:** As a user, I want form validation errors to be displayed consistently across all HR forms, so that I can easily understand and fix any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a form field has an error THEN it SHALL use the error styling from the design system (border-error, text-error)
2. WHEN a form field is required THEN it SHALL show the required indicator using consistent styling
3. WHEN form validation fails THEN error messages SHALL use consistent typography and color (text-error)
4. WHEN a form is loading THEN it SHALL show consistent loading states using the Button component's disabled state
5. WHEN a form is successfully submitted THEN it SHALL provide consistent feedback using the design system

### Requirement 6: Responsive Design Consistency

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want HR components to work well on mobile, tablet, and desktop, so that I can access HR functions from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing HR components on mobile THEN they SHALL use responsive spacing and sizing
2. WHEN viewing forms on mobile THEN they SHALL stack appropriately and maintain usability
3. WHEN viewing the Document Library on tablet THEN the sidebar SHALL adapt appropriately
4. WHEN viewing HR components on different screen sizes THEN glass effects SHALL be optimized for performance
5. WHEN using reduced motion preferences THEN animations SHALL be disabled appropriately

### Requirement 7: Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want all HR components to be fully accessible, so that I can use all HR functions effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be focusable with visible focus indicators
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN all form elements SHALL have proper labels and descriptions
3. WHEN viewing components THEN color contrast SHALL meet WCAG AA standards
4. WHEN interacting with forms THEN error states SHALL be announced to screen readers
5. WHEN using the application THEN all interactive elements SHALL have appropriate ARIA attributes

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want HR components to load and respond quickly, so that I can work efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading HR components THEN glass effects SHALL not impact performance significantly
2. WHEN rendering large lists (documents, applications) THEN components SHALL use efficient rendering patterns
3. WHEN using animations THEN they SHALL respect the user's motion preferences
4. WHEN loading forms THEN they SHALL render progressively without layout shifts
5. WHEN interacting with components THEN responses SHALL feel immediate and smooth
